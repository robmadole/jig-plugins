Whitespace
==========

This plugin checks the entire contents of any staged file for common whitespace
issues. Namely:

* A line with nothing but whitespace
* A line that ends with whitespace
* A mixture of tab and spaces

A line with nothing but whitespace usually occurs when an editor has some kind
of smart indent.

    ⚠  line 9: README
        is nothing but whitespace

Whitespace at the end of a paragraph can sometimes be caused by bad paragraph
breaks.

    ⚠  line 10: README
        ends with whitespace

Mixing tabs and spaces makes everyone unhappy. That can be caught too.
