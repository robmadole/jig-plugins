JSHint
======

JSHint is a community-driven tool to detect errors and potential problems in
JavaScript code and to enforce your team's coding conventions.

It is very flexible so you can easily adjust it to your particular coding
guidelines and the environment you expect your code to execute in.

This plugin uses Node.js and JSHint to format messages about the quality of
the code in JavaScript files.

If we leave a semicolon off a line, that's the kind of thing that JSHint will catch.

.. expectation::
    :from: 01
    :to: 02

    ▾  jshint

    ⚠  line 2: a.js
            var test = 1
        Missing semicolon. @ chr 17

    ⚠  line 1: a.js
        Unused variable: main

    ⚠  line 2: a.js
        Unused variable: test

Fixing this problem quiets things down.

.. expectation::
    :from: 02
    :to: 03

It will ignore any file that doesn't end in ``.js``

.. expectation::
    :from: 03
    :to: 04

And one of the unit tests that passes from the JSHint project passes just fine
in this plugin as well.

.. expectation::
    :from: 04
    :to: 05

One of the failing tests shows each error.

.. expectation::
    :from: 05
    :to: 06
